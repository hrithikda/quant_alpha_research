Quantitative Alpha Research Platform
Overview
The Quantitative Alpha Research Platform is an interactive tool for conducting financial research and backtesting trading strategies using machine learning and technical indicators. This project integrates data collection, feature engineering, model training, and a web-based dashboard to visualize stock performance and trading signals.

Key Features
Data Collection: Pulls historical stock prices using Yahoo Finance (yfinance).
Feature Engineering: Computes key technical indicators:
RSI (Relative Strength Index)
MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
Bollinger Bands
Lagged Returns
Machine Learning Model: Trains a Random Forest Classifier to predict buy/sell signals.
Backtesting: Simulates a trading strategy using Backtrader and evaluates performance.
Streamlit Dashboard: Displays interactive charts, key metrics (ROC AUC, Confusion Matrix), and prediction samples.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python 3.x
Libraries:
yfinance: Historical stock data fetching.
pandas, numpy: Data manipulation and feature engineering.
scikit-learn: Machine learning model training and evaluation.
backtrader: Trading strategy simulation.
streamlit: Interactive web dashboard.
matplotlib: Data visualization for backtest results.
Installation Guide
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/QuantAlphaResearchPlatform.git
cd QuantAlphaResearchPlatform
Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Python installed, then run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Application:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run main.py
The dashboard will open in your default web browser.

Usage Instructions
Enter the desired stock ticker (e.g., AAPL for Apple) and set the date range.
The platform will:
Fetch historical stock data.
Compute technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.).
Train a Random Forest model to generate buy/sell signals.
Run backtests and display performance metrics.
View results in the dashboard, including:
Stock price and indicator plots.
Model accuracy (ROC AUC score).
Confusion matrix and prediction samples.
Future Enhancements
Add live trading support using APIs (e.g., Alpaca, Interactive Brokers).
Include Explainable AI (XAI) features to improve transparency.
Add hyperparameter tuning improvements and support for additional models (e.g., XGBoost).
